# TxBitsDeployer

An Ansible config to help you deploy TxBits in production.

## Usage

1. git clone https://github.com/txbits/TxBitsDeployer.git
1. `bootstrap.sh`
1. Continue in one of the two sections below

### In development / staging

1. Set up a virtual machine with 512 MB of ram and 1 core. We recommend VirtualBox for this. *
1. Install **Debian 7.x** on it, add your ssh key and clone it into 7 machines, this one is important, since deploying any other distro such as Ubuntu 14.04 will lead to odd DPKG and Locale errors.
1. Check the ips of the machines and put them into `playbook/group_vars/staging_testnet`
1. On your host set up your hosts file like this:
    ```
    192.168.56.107       longcat.staging-testnet-txbits.com
    192.168.56.104     grumpycat.staging-testnet-txbits.com
    192.168.56.106       limecat.staging-testnet-txbits.com
    192.168.56.102   businesscat.staging-testnet-txbits.com
    192.168.56.105        bitcat.staging-testnet-txbits.com
    192.168.56.103       litecat.staging-testnet-txbits.com
    192.168.56.108          mail.staging-testnet-txbits.com

    192.168.56.107               staging-testnet-txbits.com
    192.168.56.104       monitor.staging-testnet-txbits.com
    ```
1. `./initial_deploy.sh staging_testnet`

* You may be able to do this faster with Vagrant, but we haven't tried doing it yet.

### In production

1. Set up the 7 machines as described above, but this time with a VPS provider. The bitcoin virtual machine might need more storage than the 20GB you get with Digital Ocean for $5/month. Check the current size of the blockchain. Make sure all the machines can talk to each other over a LAN (even though all communication between them is encrypted)
1. Copy `playbook/staging_testnet_hosts` to `playbook/production_hosts` and replace any references to `staging_testnet` with `production`
1. Copy `playbook/group_vars/staging_testnet` to `playbook/group_vars/production` if it doesn't already exist
1. Update the private ips in `playbook/group_vars/production`
1. Create a secrets file in `playbook/secrets` called `production.json` based on `staging_testnet.json`
1. Install the only dependency for gen.py: `pip3 install passlib`
1. Run `python3 ./gen.py production.json`
1. `./initial_deploy.sh production`


### Setting up the database

After deploying, you'll need to set up the database in order for the frontend to start up. It should be as simple as:

1. `./dbmigrate.sh <environment>`
1. `./dbpopulate.sh <environment>`

After deploying the database you'll need to restart the `frontend` and `wallet`.
